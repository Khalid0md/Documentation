<p>
    The workspace directory initially has following structure:
</p>

<?
$isCLIDocs=false;
include(DOCS_RESOURCES."/cli/init/structure.php");
?>

<p>As you add <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/getting-started'>projects</a>, the project files are added to your workspace directory. If you create and use <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/shared-libraries'>shared libraries</a> in your projects, the library files are added to a <span class='public-directory-name'>Library</span> directory in your workspace.</p>
