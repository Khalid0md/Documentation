We encourage a hybrid "cloud + local" workflow, so you can use right tool for each stage of your development process. With the Local Platform, you can create, debug, and run projects on premise while using your own on-site tools. With the Cloud Platform you can deploy backtests at scale, and harness our massive data library at low cost.

The deployment target setting allows you to switch modes from Local to Cloud Platforms, chosing where you run your algorithm. Local Platform targets are denoted with blue icons, where Cloud Platform targets have gold colored icons.
