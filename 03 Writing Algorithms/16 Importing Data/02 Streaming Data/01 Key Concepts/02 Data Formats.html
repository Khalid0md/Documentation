<p>Common data formats are <span class="public-file-name">CSV</span>, <span class="public-file-name">JSON</span>, and <span class="public-file-name">XML</span>, but you can use any file type that can be read over the internet. Each request has a one-second overhead, so you should package your custom data to minimize requests. Bundle dates together where possible to speed up execution. Just ensure the data in the file is in chronological order.</p>

<p>For Excel files, please double check the raw data format for parsing in the data reader, since data will be formatted for convenient visualization in Excel application view. To avoid confusion of data format, save the spreadsheet as a <span class="public-file-name">CSV</span> file and use that as reference.</p>
