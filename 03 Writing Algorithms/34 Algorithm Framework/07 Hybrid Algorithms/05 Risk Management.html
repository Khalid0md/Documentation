<p>Some Risk Management models don't require the Portfolio Construction model to provide <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects. If you add one of these Risk Management models to a classic algorithm, it's a hybrid algorithm. To see which pre-built Risk Management models don't need the Portfolio Construction model to provide <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects, see <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/execution/supported-models">Supported Models</a>.</p>
