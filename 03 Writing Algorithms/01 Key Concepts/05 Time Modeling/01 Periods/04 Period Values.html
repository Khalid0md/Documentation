<p>Bars aggregate data across a period of time into a single object. We make this easy for you by pre-aggregating billions of raw trade-ticks into <code>TradeBar</code> objects and quote-ticks into <code>QuoteBar</code> objects.</p>

<p>We don't know the close of a bar until the start of the next bar, which can sometimes be confusing. For example, a price bar for Friday will include all the ticks from Friday 00:00:00 to Friday 23:59:59.99999, but LEAN will emit it to your algorithm on Saturday at midnight. As a result, if you analyze the Friday data and then place an order, LEAN sends the order to your brokerage on Saturday.</p>

<p>When there are no ticks during a period, LEAN emits the previous bar. This is the default behavior for bar data and it's referred to as "filling the data forward". You can enable and disable this setting when you create the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/requesting-data">security subscription</a>.</p>

<p>We provide bar data in second, minute, hour, and daily bar formats. To create other periods of bars, see <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/consolidating-data/getting-started">Consolidating Data</a>.</p>
