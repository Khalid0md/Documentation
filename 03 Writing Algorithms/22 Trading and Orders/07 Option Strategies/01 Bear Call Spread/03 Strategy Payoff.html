<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit you receive from opening the trade, $C^{ITM}_0 - C^{OTM}_0$. If the price declines, both calls expire worthless.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is $K^{OTM} - K^{ITM} + C^{ITM}_0 - C^{OTM}_0$, which occurs when the underlying price is above the strike prices of both call Option contracts.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contract.</p>
