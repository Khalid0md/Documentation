<p>The iron butterfly can be long or short.</p>

<p>The maximum profit is $K^C_{OTM} - K^C_{ATM} - C^{ATM}_0 - P^{ATM}_0 + C^{OTM}_0 + P^{OTM}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price is below the OTM put strike price or above the OTM call strike price at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid, $C^{OTM}_0 + P^{OTM}_0 - C^{ATM}_0 - P^{ATM}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price stays the same as when you opened the trade.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.</p>
