<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit you received when opening the position, $P^{ITM}_0 - P^{OTM}_0$. If the underlying price is higher than the strike prices of both put contracts at expiration, both puts expire worthless.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is $K^{ITM} - K^{OTM} + P^{ITM}_0 - P^{OTM}_0$.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contract.</p>
