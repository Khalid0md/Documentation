<p>The bear put spread is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>

<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>

<p>The maximum profit is $K^{ITM} - K^{OTM} + P^{OTM}_0 - P^{ITM}_0$. If the underlying price is below than the strike prices of both put Option contracts, they are worth $(K - S_T)$ at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit you paid to open the position, $P^{OTM}_0 - P^{ITM}_0$.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contract.</p>
