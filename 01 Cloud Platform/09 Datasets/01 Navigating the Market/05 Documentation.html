<p>The <span class="tab-name">Documentation</span> tab on a dataset listing demonstrates how to use the dataset. The documentation covers requesting the data, accessing the data in your algorithm, and performing history requests. We provide documentation in C# and Python so you can easily integrate the dataset into your algorithms, regardless of the programming language you use.</p>

<p>The <span class="tab-name">Documentation</span> tab also has a <span class="page-section-name">Data Point Attributes</span> section to show the dataset's attributes. If an attribute has a custom data type, you can click the attribute to view the attributes of the custom data type.</p>
