  We launched the Research Guide in 2019 to inform you about common quantitative
  research pitfalls. It displays a power gauge for the number of backtests
  performed, the number of parameters used, and the time invested in the
  strategy. These measures can give a ballpark estimate of the
  overfitting risk of the project. Generally, as a strategy becomes
  more overfit on historical data, it is less likely to perform well in live
  trading. These properties were selected based on the recommended best
  practices of the global quantitative research community.

<h4>Restricting Backtests</h4>

  According to current research, the number of backtests performed on an idea
  should be limited to prevent overfitting. In theory, each backtest performed
  on an idea moves it one step closer to being overfitted as you are testing and
  selecting for strategies written into your code instead of being based on a
  central thesis. For more information, see the paper

  QuantConnect does not restrict the number of backtests performed on a project,
  but we have implemented the counter as a guide for your reference. Your coding
  skills are a factor in how many backtests constitute overfitting, so if you
  are a new programmer you can increase these targets.

<h4>Reducing Strategy Parameters</h4>

  With just a handful of parameters, it is possible to create an algorithm that
  perfectly models historical markets. Current
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12320">research</a> suggests
  keeping your parameter count to a minimum to decrease the risk of overfitting.

<h4>Limiting Research Time Invested</h4>

  As you spend more time on one algorithm,
  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2308659"
    >research suggests</a
  >
  you are more likely to be overfitting the strategy to the data. It is common
  to become attached to an idea and spend weeks or months to perform well in a
  backtest. Assuming you are a proficient coder who fully understands the
  QuantConnect API, we recommend no more than 16 hours of work per experiment.
  In theory, within two full working days, you should be able to test a single
  hypothesis thoroughly.
