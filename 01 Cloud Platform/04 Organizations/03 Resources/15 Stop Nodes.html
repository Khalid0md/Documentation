<p>You need <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/members#08-Permissions">stop node permissions</a> in the organization to stop nodes other members are using. If you stop a node, it terminates the running backtest, research, or live trading sessions. When you stop a live trading node, the portfolio holdings don't change but the algorithm stops executing.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to stop nodes that are running in your organization:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/resources#11-View-All-Nodes">Resources</a> page.</li>
    <li>Click the icon with the <span class="icon-name">three horizontal lines</span> icon in the top-right corner to format the page into table view.<br></li>

</ol>
