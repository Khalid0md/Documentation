<p>Use the deployment wizard in the Algorithm Lab to <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages">deploy your algorithms to live trading</a>. The deployment wizard lets you select a brokerage, enter your brokerage credentials, select a data feed, select a live trading node, set up notifications, and configure automatic algorithm restarts.</p>

<p>Most of the brokerages automatically load your cash holdings, position holdings, and submitted orders so that you can view your portfolio state on the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/results">live results page</a>. For brokerages that don't automatically load your holdings, you can enter your cash and position holdings in the deployment wizard.</p>
