<p>We model the order fees of Binance and Binance US at the VIP 0 level, which is a 0.1% maker and taker fee. If you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. Binance adjusts your fees based on your 30-day trading volume and BNB balance, but we don't currently model these metrics to adjust fees. To check the latest fees at all the fee levels, see the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.binance.com/en/fee/schedule">Trading Fees</a> page on the Binance.com website or the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.binance.us/en/fee/schedule">Fee Structure</a> page on the Binance.us website. The Binance Spot Test Network does not charge order fees.</p>
