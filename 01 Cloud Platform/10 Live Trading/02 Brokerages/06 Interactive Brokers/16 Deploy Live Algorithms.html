<p>You must have an available <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/resources#04-Live-Trading-Nodes">live trading node</a> for each live trading algorithm you deploy.<br></p>

<p>Follow these steps to deploy a live algorithm:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/getting-started#02-View-All-Projects">Open the project</a> that you want to deploy.</li>
    <li>Click the <img class="inline-icon" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/deploy-live-icon.png" alt="lightning icon"> <span class="icon-name">Deploy Live</span> icon.</li>
    <li>On the Deploy Live page, click the <span class="field-name">Brokerage</span> field and then click <span class="button-name">Interactive Brokers</span> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Enter your IB user name, ID, and password.</li>
    <p>Your account details are not saved on QuantConnect.</p>
    <li>In the <span class="field-name">Weekly Restart UTC</span> field, enter the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time of when you want to receive notifications on Sundays to re-authenticate your account connection.</li>
    <p>For example, 4 PM UTC is equivalent to 11 AM Eastern Standard Time, 12 PM Eastern Daylight Time, 8 AM Pacific Standard Time, and 9 AM Pacific Daylight Time. To convert from UTC to a different time zone, see the <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://www.utctime.net/utc-time-zone-converter'>UTC Time Zone Converter</a> on the UTC Time website.</p>
    <p>If your IB account has 2FA enabled, you receive a notification on your IB Key device every Sunday to re-authenticate the connection between IB and your live algorithm. If you don't re-authenticate before the timeout period, your algorithm quits executing.</p>
    <li>Click the <span class="field-name">Data Provider</span> field and then click one of the data feeds from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <p>The following table describes the available data feeds:</p>
    <table class="qc-table table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Data Feed</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>QuantConnect</td>
                <td>Use data collected across all of the exchanges. For more details about this data feed, see <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/data-feeds">Data Feeds</a>.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>IB</td>
                <td>Use data sourced directly from IB. For more details about this data feed, see the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/data-feeds/brokerage-data-feeds/interactive-brokers">IB data feed</a> guide.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>QuantConnect + IB</td>
                <td>Use a combination of the QuantConnect and IB data feeds. For more details about this option, see <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/data-feeds/brokerage-data-feeds/interactive-brokers#07-Hybrid-QuantConnect-Data-Feed">Hybrid QuantConnect Data Feed</a>.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <li>If you have subscriptions to <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/data-feeds/brokerage-data-feeds/interactive-brokers">IB data feeds</a> and want to use them, click the <span class="field-name">Data Provider</span> field and then click <span class="button-name">Interactive Brokers</span> from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <p>If you use IB data feeds and trade with a paper trading account, you need to share the data feed with your paper trading account. For instructions on sharing data feeds, see <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages/interactive-brokers#02-Account-Types">Account Types</a>.</p>
    <li>Click the <span class="field-name">Node</span> field and then click the live trading node that you want to use from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li><span class="qualifier">(Optional)</span> <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/notifications">Set up notifications</a>.</li>
    <li>Configure the <span class="box-name">Automatically restart algorithm</span> setting.</li>
    <p>By enabling automatic restarts, the algorithm will use best efforts to restart the algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error. This can help improve the algorithm's resilience to temporary outages such as a brokerage API disconnection.</p>
    <li>Click <span class="button-name">Deploy</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The deployment process can take up to 5 minutes. When the algorithm deploys, the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/results">live results page</a> displays. If you know your brokerage positions before you deployed, you can verify they have been loaded properly by checking your equity value in the runtime statistics, your cashbook holdings, and your position holdings.</p>
