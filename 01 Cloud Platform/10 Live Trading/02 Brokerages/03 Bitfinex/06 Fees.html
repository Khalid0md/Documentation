<p>We model the order fees of Bitfinex, which are a 0.1% maker fee and a 0.2% taker fee. If you place a limit order that hits a hidden order or you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you place a hidden order or you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. Bitfinex adjusts your fees based on your 30-day trading volume and LEO balance, but we don't currently model these metrics to adjust fees. To check the latest fees at all the fee levels, see the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bitfinex.com/fees/">Fees Schedule</a> page on the Bitfinex website.</p>

<p>To use the Bitfinex brokerage in a live algorithm, the following table shows the fee settings you need on your <span class="menu-name">Account &gt; Fees</span> page on the Bitfinex website:</p>
