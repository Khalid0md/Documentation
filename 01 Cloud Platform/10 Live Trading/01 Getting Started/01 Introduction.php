<p>A live algorithm is an algorithm that trades in real-time with real market data. QuantConnect enables you to run your algorithms in live mode with real-time market data. Deploy your algorithms using QuantConnect because our infrastructure is battle-tested. We have successfully hosted more than <?=$kpi["live-algorithms-count"]?> live algorithms and have had more than <?=$kpi["volume-traded"]?> in volume traded on our servers since 2015. The algorithms that our members create are run on co-located servers and the trading infrastructure is maintained at all times by our team of engineers. It's common for members to achieve 6-months of uptime with no interruptions.</p>
