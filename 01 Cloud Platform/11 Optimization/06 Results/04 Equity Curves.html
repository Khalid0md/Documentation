<p>The optimization results page displays a Strategy Equities chart so that you can analyze the equity curves of the individual backtests in the optimization job.</p>

<p>The equity curves of the backtests update in real-time as the optimization job runs. View the Strategy Equities chart to see how the parameter values affect the equity of your algorithm, to see how sensitive the returns are to the range of parameters selected by the optimizer, and to take a closer look at specific times in the backtest history.</p>
