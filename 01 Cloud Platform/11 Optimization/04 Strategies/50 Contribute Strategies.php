<p>You can contribute any optimization strategy that is popular in the literature and is not already implemented. To view the optimization strategies that are already implemented, see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Optimizer/Strategies">our GitHub repository</a>. If you contribute a strategy, you'll receive some <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/credit">QuantConnect Credit</a>, you'll be shown as a contributor to Lean on your GitHub profile, and your work will be used in the Algorithm Lab by our community of over <?=$kpi["member-count"] ?> quants.</p>

<p>To contribute optimization strategies, submit a pull request to the <a target='_blank' rel='nofollow' href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean'>Lean GitHub repository</a>. In your pull request, provide an explanation of the strategy and some relevant resources so that we can add the strategy to our documentation. For an example implementation, see the <a target="_blank" rel='nofollow' href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Optimizer/Strategies/GridSearchOptimizationStrategy.cs'>GridSearchOptimizationStrategy</a>.</p>
