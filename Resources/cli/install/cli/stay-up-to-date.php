    We regularly update the CLI to add new features and to fix issues.
    Therefore, it's important to keep both the CLI and the Docker images that the CLI uses up-to-date.

    To update the CLI to the latest version, run <code>pip install --upgrade lean</code>.
    The CLI automatically performs a version check once a day and warns you in case you are running an outdated version.
