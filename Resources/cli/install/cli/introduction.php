    The Lean CLI is distributed as a Python package, so it requires <code>pip</code> to be installed. To learn how to install <code>pip</code> on your operating system, see <a href='<?=$pipLink?>'>Installing pip</a>.

    The commands which run the LEAN engine locally also depend on <a href='https://www.docker.com/' target='_blank'>Docker</a> being installed and running. See <a href='<?=$dockerLink?>'>Installing Docker</a> to learn how to install Docker on your operating system.
