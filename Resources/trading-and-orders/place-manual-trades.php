You can use any order type that is supported by the brokerage that you used when deploying the algorithm. To view the supported order types of your brokerage, see the <span class='page-section-name'>Orders</span> section of your <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages'>brokerage guide</a>. Some example situations where it may be helpful to place manual orders instead of stopping and redeploying the algorithm include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your brokerage account had holdings in it before you deployed your algorithm</li>
    <li>Your algorithm had bugs in it that caused it to purchase the wrong security</li>
    <li>You want to add a hedge to your portfolio without adjusting the algorithm code</li>
    <li>You want to rebalance your portfolio before the rebalance date</li>
</ul>
