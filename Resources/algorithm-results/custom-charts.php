<p>The results page shows the custom charts that you create.</p>
<h4>Supported Chart Types</h4>
<p>We support the following types of charts:</p>
<div data-tree='QuantConnect.SeriesType'></div>
<p>If you use <code>SeriesType.Candle</code> and plot enough values, the plot displays candlesticks. However, the <code>Plot</code> method only accepts one numerical value per time step, so you can't plot candles that represent the open, high, low, and close values of each bar in your algorithm. The charting software automatically groups the data points you provide to create the candlesticks, so you can't control the period of time that each candlestick represents.</p>

<? if ($backtest) { ?>
<p>To create other types of charts, save the plot data in the ObjectStore and then load it into the Research Environment. In the Research Environment, you can <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/charting'>create other types of charts with third-party charting packages</a>.</p>
<? } ?>

<h4>Supported Markers</h4>
<p>When you create scatter plots, you can set a marker symbol. We support the following marker symbols:</p>
<div data-tree='QuantConnect.ScatterMarkerSymbol'></div>

<h4>Chart Quotas</h4>



<? if ($backtest) { ?>
<p>Custom charts are limited to 4,000 data points. Intensive charting requires hundreds of megabytes of data, which is too much to stream online or display in a web browser. If you exceed the quota, the Cloud Terminal displays the following message:</p>
<p><span class='error-messages'>Exceeded maximum points per chart, data skipped</span></p>
<? } ?>

<p>You can create up to 10 custom chart series per algorithm. If you exceed the quota, your algorithm stops executing and the Cloud Terminal displays the following message:</p>
<p><span class='error-messages'>Exceeded maximum series count: Each backtest can have up to 10 series in total.</span></p>
