<p>This page explains how to you can use the Research Environment to develop and test a Long Short Term Memory hypothesis, then put the hypothesis in production.</p>

<p>Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a powerful tool in deep learning. These models quite accurately mimic how humans process sequencial information and learn. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have memory. That is, information fed into them persists and the network is able to draw on this to make inferences.
<br/><br/>
Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) is a type of RNN. Instead of one layer, LSTM cells generally have four, three of which are part of "gates" -- ways to optionally let information through. The three gates are commonly referred to as the forget, input, and output gates. The forget gate layer is where the model decides what information to keep from prior states. At the input gate layer, the model decides which values to update. Finally, the output gate layer is where the final output of the cell state is decided. Essentially, LSTM separately decides what to remember and the rate at which it should update.</p>
